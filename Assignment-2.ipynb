    "Ans: Classes provide an easy way of keeping the data members and methods together in one place which helps in keeping the program more organized.\n",
    "Using classes also provides another functionality of this object-oriented programming paradigm, that is, inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are simply files with the \". py\" extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions/Classes that you want to include in your program."

    "Ans: For creating a class instance. we call a class by its name and pass the arguments which its \"__init__\" method accepts.\n",

    "Ans: Class attributes are the variables defined directly in the class that are shared by all objects of the class. Hence these attributes are usually created/defined in the top of class definiation outside all methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the below example, count is an attribute in the Student class. Whenever a new object is created, the value of count is incremented by 1. You can now access the count attribute after creating the objects.\n",

    "### Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "Ans: Instances attributes are passed to the class when an object of the class is created. Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by all objects of the classs. instead each object maintains its own copy of instance attributes at object level. whereas incase of class attributes all instances of class refer to a single copy. Usually instance attributes are defined within the \"__init__\" method of class."

By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class with in the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments."
