    "### Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Ans: \"_ _ _iter_ _ _\" and \"_ _ _next_ _ _\" are the operator overloading methods in python that support iteration and are collectively called iterator protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"_ _ _iter_ _ _\" returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"_ _ _next_ _ _\" is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value. Also Stopiteration is raised when there is no value to return."

    "Ans: slice is a constructor in Python that creates slice object to represent set of indices that the range(start, stop, step) specifies._ _ _getitem_ _ _ method can be implement in a class, and the behavior of slicing can be defined inside it.\n"

    "### Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?\n",
    "Ans:\"a+=b\" is inplace addition operation. In this in-place addition \"a\" itself will store the value of addition. In a class \"_ _ _iadd_ _ _\" method is used for this in-place operation"

    "### Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans: Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class."
