    "### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "Ans:  An abstract class in Python is typically created to declare a set of methods that must be created in any child class built on top of this abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class.Whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation"

    "Ans: if a child class has __init__ method, then it will not inherit the \"__init__\" method of the parent class or override the __init__ method of parent class. so we have to manually call a parent superclass's \"__init__\" using \"super()\" method."
