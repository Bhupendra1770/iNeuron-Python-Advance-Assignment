    "### Q1. What is the difference between '_ __ _getattr_ _ _ 'and ' _ _ _getattribute_ _ _?\n",
    "Ans: _ _ _getattribute_ _ _ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. _ _ _getattr_ _ _ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by  _ _ _getattribute_ _ _ , but for this _ _ _getattribute_ _ _ and _ _ _getattr_ _ _ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, _ _ _getattr_ _ _ returns a default value. "

    "Ans: The differences between Properties and Descriptors is:\n",
    "- Properties: With Properties we can bind getter, setter and delete functions together with an attribute name, using the built-in property function or '@property' decorator.\n",
    "- Descriptor: With Descriptor we can bind getter, setter and delete functions into a seperate class. we then assign an object of this class to the attribute name in our main class. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access but invokes an appropriate function of descriptor object."
