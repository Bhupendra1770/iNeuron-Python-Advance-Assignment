    "### Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "Ans:In Python, the with statement replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand. More importantly, it ensures closing resources right after processing them.This avoids triggering of exceptions if file closing is unknowingly forgotten in the code execution. A common example of using the with statement is reading or writing to a file.\n"
