    "### Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Ans: Inheritence is nothing but reusing the code of Parent class by the child class. Similary when a child class inherits its properties from multiple Parent classes this scenario is called \"Multiple Inheritence\""

    "### Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "Ans: The delegation pattern is an object-oriented design pattern that allows object composition to achieve the same code reuse as inheritance.Simply Delegation means that you can include a instance of another class as an instance variable, and forward messages to the instance."

    "### Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "Ans: In the concept of Composition, a class refers to one or more other classes by using instances of those classes as a instance variable. irrespective of inheritence in this approach all the parent class members are not inherited into child class, but only required methods from a class are used by using class instances."

    "### Q4. What are bound methods and how do we use them?\n",
    "Ans: If a function is an attribute of class and it is accessed via the instances, they are called \"bound methods\". A bound method is one that has \"self\" as its first argument. Since these are dependent on the instance of classes, these are also known as \"instance methods\"."

    "### Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "Ans: Within a class method in Python, whenever a method assigns to a self attribute (e.g., self.attr=value), it changes or creates an attribute in the instance (inheritance search only happens on reference, not assignment). Because this is true even if multiple classes in a hierarchy assign to the same attribute, collisions are possible.Pseudoprivate names also prevent subclasses from accidentally redefining the internal method's names."
